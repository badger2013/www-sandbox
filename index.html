        Historically giving birth in an upright position was the norm. However in recent years laying down or propped up
        in a semi-recumbent position has been adopted out of convenience for the attending physician. An increasing
        number of studies indicate this is not an optimal birthing position.

        Freedom of movement is essential to achieve a normal physiologic birth.<sup><a href="#14">[14]</a></sup> In fact, upright birthing positions
        are optimal for humans (and all mammals with this fetal head to pelvic outlet ratio).
